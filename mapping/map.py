 What is Mapping?
Mapping refers to associating elements from one set with elements in another set.
Think of it as creating a relationship or a connection between two entities.

For example:

Mapping students to grades:
"Alice → A", "Bob → B", "Charlie → A"
Here, each student is associated (mapped) to a grade.
Mapping keys to values in a dictionary:
"name → Yogesh", "age → 23", "year → 1991"
