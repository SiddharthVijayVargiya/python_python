'''List Comprehension with a Filter Condition:
Syntax: [expression for item in iterable if condition]

Purpose: Filters the elements of the iterable 
based on the condition
before applying the expression.

Example: Extract words that contain the letter 'z':

python
Copy code
words_with_z = [word for word in words if 'z' in word]
This will create a new list containing 
only the words that have 'z'.

2. List Comprehension with a Conditional Expression:
Syntax: [expression1 if condition else expression2 
for item in iterable]

Purpose: Applies expression1 if the condition is True,
otherwise applies expression2. This doesnâ€™t filter 
out elements but 
rather transforms them based on the condition.

Example: Replace words that contain the letter 'z'
with "contains_z":'''
