'''
You have a list of strings containing various words. 
Write a Python code that iterates through the list, 
checks if any word contains the letter 'z', and if so, 
replaces that word with the string "contains_z".
'''
words =['aaaaa','zzzzzzz','lzlzl','z']
x = ['contains_z'

Question:
You have a list of integers.
Write a Python code that iterates through 
the list and replaces every multiple of 3 with the 
string "multiple_of_3".
'''
numbers =[]

    value = int(input())

Question:
You want to iterate through a list of numbers and check if any number is greater than 100. 
If a number is greater than 100, replace it with the string "large". 
How can you achieve this in Python?'''

Question:
Given a list of names, 
write a Python code that replaces any name longer than 5 characters with the string "long_name".

Write a Python code that iterates through the list and replaces all float values with the string "float_value".
