'''
so reason why we take K is we want 
something common reference in both matrix am i right 
?
'''


'''
Yes, you're absolutely right!

The reason we introduce k in matrix multiplication is that we need a common reference
between the two matrices for the multiplication process. Specifically:

The k index allows us to pair elements from a row of matrix A with elements from a column of matrix B.
In each step, A[i][k] refers to an element in the i-th row of A, and B[k][j] refers to an element in the j-th column of B.
Since the number of columns in A must match the number of rows in B, k is the shared dimension, acting as a "bridge" 
for combining elements from these two matrices. The third loop over k ensures we multiply all corresponding pairs and
then sum them to compute the resulting element.

So yes, k serves as the common reference that allows the row of A and the column of B to align for proper multiplication!
